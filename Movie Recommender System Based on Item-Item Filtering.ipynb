One being a content-based filter and the other being user-user (or collaborative) filters. Collaborative filtering is when a recommendation is made based upon what other people liked whose tastes are similar to your own. Ex. If many people who rated 'Rambo' highly also rated 'The Expendables' highly, recommending to you \"The expandables\" based on your high rating of 'Rambo'. Content-based filter is based upon recommending movies based of the movies properties which are similar to past content you've liked. Ex. Recommending highly rated 1980s sci-fi films 'Aliens' or 'The Fly' to a retro sci-fi film fanatic.\n","\n","The source used for this project was as listed below. These researchers in 2015 gathered 22884377 ratings and 586994 tag applications across 34208 movies created by 247753 users between January 09, 1995 and January 29, 2016 from the movie website MovieLens.org. Users were selected at random for inclusion from a pool of users who had rated at least 1 movie.\n","\n","F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context.
