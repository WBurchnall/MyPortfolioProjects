# Introduction
_The boring educational background details_
- Bachelor of Applied Sciences in Manufacturing (Applied Mechanical) Engineering from UBC
- IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate
- IBM Data Science Professional Certificate 
- IBM Data Warehouse Engineering Professional Certificate

During my undergrad, I 
- worked full time in the customer service/accounting industry as a Hotel Night Auditor verifying financial transactions

- maintained 86.3% upper level average and achieved Dean's Honour List both senior years

- was recepitent of the EGBC Certificate of Achievement Award given to the student showing "Most Promise for Engineering Discipline". 

- lead and programmed an image classifier capstone project with multiple methods of pre-training different machine learning classifiers including KNN, VGG16 pre-weights, transfer learning, save points during training, common CNNs trained from scratch such as LeNet, to custom convolutional neural networks.

- programmed a complete MES in a combination of Python, MySQL and PLC programming to successfully manage a order/production management databases and GUI. This manufacturing project included using PySide6 for a Python GUI and 3rd normalized form for placing orders, entering customer info and updating order info. Finally, PLC programming via TIA Portal v16 and OPC-UA communication was used to communicate assembly instructions to 8 different PLCs in an assembly line to produce a customized final product.

- created an excel dashboard to determine the viability of the Keystone Pipeline Expansion Project. The dashboard evaluated factors of O&M, Interest, Maintenance, Income and so-forth would have on profitability. The dashboard utilized a combination of slicers, sliders and spark lines showing future-estimates based off a model of past-performance. This data was cleaned and obtained through an ELT pipeline assertained from quarterly/yearly investor statement data. Transformation process included adjustment for inflation using CPI FV/PV formulas. The result was a first place project finish out of over 200 students.

- completed two major Tableau data science projects: 
- - The development of a complete ELT pipeline for determining likelihood of the Canadian real estate market contracting. This assessment was a multi-factor analysis based upon historical MLS realtor data from the 1980s onwards, Statistics Canada CPI Index, Census Data for Population, Income and 20 other factors. Using linear regression, clustering and other techniques, factors were weighted for P values and the top 5 factors were picked. This included scraping, cleaning and transforming the data from multiple sources in different formats and outputting the result as a csv, loading into Tableau and creating an interactive dashboard.
- - The examination of tree-planting data by species, neighbourhood and time of Vancouver trees from 1990 onward in Tableau.  

- completed two three-semester and one two-semester post-graduate cerificates from IBM in Data Science, Engineering and Warehousing related to cloud computing, database design, SQL/NoSQL, data visualization, test automation, DevOPS, data visualization, modelling and other topics
