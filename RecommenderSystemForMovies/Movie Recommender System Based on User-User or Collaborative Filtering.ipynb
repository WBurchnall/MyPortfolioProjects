One being a content-based filter and the other being user-user (or collaborative) filters. Collaborative filtering is when a recommendation is made based upon what other people liked whose tastes are similar to your own. Ex. If many people who rated 'Rambo' highly also rated 'The Expendables' highly, recommending to you \"The expandables\" based on your high rating of 'Rambo'. Content-based filter is based upon recommending movies based of the movies properties which are similar to past content you've liked. Ex. Recommending highly rated 1980s sci-fi films 'Aliens' or 'The Fly' to a retro sci-fi film fanatic.\n","\n","The source used for this project was as listed below. These researchers in 2015 gathered 22884377 ratings and 586994 tag applications across 34208 movies created by 247753 users between January 09, 1995 and January 29, 2016 from the movie website MovieLens.org. Users were selected at random for inclusion from a pool of users who had rated at least 1 movie.\n","\n","F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context.

Now it's time to start our work on collaborative-filtering recommendation system.\n","\n","As mentioned earlier, this technique differents from content/item-item based filter as it doesn't look at the movie's content itself but rather this technique uses other users thoughts on a movie, by seeking users who rated movies similar to the input user. When the system attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input user and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are many methods of finding similar users including using machine learning. The one I used =here is going to be based on the *Pearson Correlation Function*.\n","\n","The process (or algorithm) for creating a User Based recommendation system is as follows:\n","\n","*   Select a sample user with the movies the input user has watched\n","*   Based on his rating of the movies, find the top X neighbours who have the closest rating. Ex. If you rate 'Rambo' 4.5, find as many users who thought 'Rambo' was a 4.5 star film. If there are not X users, find users who rated 'Rambo' either 4 or 5 stars as these two entries are closet \"distance\" to 4.5 on a number-line mathematically, then 3.5 stars, etc. Continue finding neighbours until you reach \"x\".\n","*   Get the watched movie record of the user for each of the X neighbours. So for example, if someone rated Rambo 4.5, what else did he rate? Let's say he rated \"Predator\", \"Commando\" and \"The Expendables\" all 3.5 or above. Another person who rated Rambo 4.5, rated \"Terminator\", \"Terminator 2\" and \"Commando\" all 3.5 or above.  \n","*   Calculate a similarity score using some formula. A formula might be filter movies rated 3.5 or above and count the number of occurences of the movie. Sort by highest count-first(descending). \n","*   Recommend the items with the highest score.
