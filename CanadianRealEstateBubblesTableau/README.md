## Project Outcomes

Researchers interest in this dataset is driven by a desire to purchase and own real-estate within the BC; specifically either the Okanagan Valley or Vancouver. As engineering graduates, most job opportunities are located in these regions. In the 1980s, there was a hyper-inflation of housing prices followed by a subsequent crash that took nearly 12 years to recover property values. From 2020 to 2021, YTD some areas have shown a 30-40% rise in housing prices. Similar YTD increases occured from 2020 to 2019 and 2019 to 2018. This growth is unprecedented except in the 1980s. 

Consequently, there is concern a market crash could be imminent. Recent property purchasers may be saddled with a mortgage greater than the value of the house. Additionally, purchasers would have received better property for the same dollar value or the same property at a cheaper cost had they purchasd after the crash. Consequently, research is drive by self-interest as the research team wish to answer the question "Is now a good time to invest in property?" and would like to investigate if a market crash is coming.

## Our datasets used
